# tucker_etal_notebook_examples_gmd2022

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that provide code and documentation for an example presented in a manuscript by G.E. Tucker and colleagues entitled "CSDMS: a community platform for numerical modeling of Earth surface processes", and accepted for publication in the journal Geoscientific Model Development as of February 2022. The two notebooks initialize and implement the simulation shown in Figure 12 in the article. They require Landlab version 2.x and its dependencies to run.
